Google is the most popular search engine in the world. If we want to know something, 
Google is the answer. Google opens up the whole world of the Internet to us for free.

The Google history started when two students of Stanford University (California), Larry 
Page and Sergey Brin, met in 1995. They had a common vision of a system which could make 
it accessible to anyone to gain information in seconds in easy-to-use way. At the time 
Internet search engines were slow and gave a lot of useless websites.

In 1996 the young scientists Page and Brin laid the foundation for a new search engine. 
They thought the results should be based on the popularity of each website – the most 
relevant ones had the highest number of links to other web pages. The domain google.com 
was registered on September 15, 1997, and the company was incorporated as Google.Inc.

Google’s corporate mission doesn’t sound modest: “To organize the information around the 
world and make it universally accessible and usable.” Its unofficial slogan is “Don’t be evil.” 
The company hopes that in the future all the world’s information will be stored on the Internet, 
so that everybody can find everything. With such innovations as map search, Gmail, YouTube, 
translation service, image search and others, Google is becoming the most important player on the 
Internet, fast, easy and accurate.
